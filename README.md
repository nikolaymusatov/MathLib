# MathLib
In this project my own version of the standard math.h library in the C programming language was developed.

# Usage
The result of compiling the code is a static library (math.a) with the following functions. 

# Compilation
A Makefile is used to build the project. Run the command `make math.a` to compile the lib. 

# Testing
The Сheck library is used to test the code. To run tests use the command `make test`.
